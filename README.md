Mongoose findOrCreate Plugin [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/drudge/mongoose-findorcreate.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drudge/mongoose-findorcreate)
============================

Simple plugin for [Mongoose](https://github.com/LearnBoost/mongoose) which adds 
a findOrCreate method to models. This is useful for libraries like 
[Passport](http://passportjs.org) which require it.

## Installation

`npm install mongoose-findorcreate`

## Usage

```javascript
var findOrCreate = require('mongoose-findorcreate')
var ClickSchema = new Schema({ ... });
ClickSchema.plugin(findOrCreate);
var Click = mongoose.model('Click', ClickSchema);
```

The Click model now has a findOrCreate static method

```javascript
Click.findOrCreate({ip: '127.0.0.1'}, function(err, click, created) {
  // created will be true here
  console.log('A new click from "%s" was inserted', click.ip);
  Click.findOrCreate({}, function(err, click, created) {
    // created will be false here
    console.log('Did not create a new click for "%s"', click.ip);
  })
});
```

You can also include properties that aren't used in the 
find call, but will be added to the object if it is created.

```javascript
Click.create({ip: '127.0.0.1'}, {browser: 'Mozilla'}, function(err, val) {
  Click.findOrCreate({ip: '127.0.0.1'}, {browser: 'Chrome'}, function(err, click) {
    console.log('A click from "%s" using "%s" was found', click.ip, click.browser);
    // prints A click from "127.0.0.1" using "Mozilla" was found
  })
});
```

The libarary now supports promises if your version of node supports Promises.
To get the promise result - pass no callback to the findOrCreate function. 

```javascript
var promise = Click.findOrCreate({ip: '127.0.0.1'}).then(function(click, created){
  console.log('A click from "%s" using "%s" was found', click.ip, click.browser);
}, function(error){
  console.log('Error: '+error);
});
```
